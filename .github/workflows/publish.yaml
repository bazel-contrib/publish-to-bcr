# Reusable workflow that can be referenced by repositories in their `.github/workflows/publish.yaml`.
#
# This workflow uses an Action within this repo to generate a BCR entry for
# a tagged release, uploads attestations for the generated source.json and MODULE.bazel files to the release,
# and opens up a pull request against the Bazel Central Registry (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-central-registry).
#
# The workflow requires the following permissions to be set on the invoking job:
#
# permissions:
#   id-token: write        # Needed to attest provenance
#   attestations: write    # Needed to attest provenance
#   contents: write        # Needed to upload release files
#
# The workflow additionally requires a Classic Personal Access Token (PAT) to be supplied in the `publish_token`
# input. The PAT is necessary to push to your BCR fork as well as to open up a pull request against a registry.
# At the moment, fine-grained PATs are not supported because they cannot open pull requests against public
# repositories, although this is on GitHub's roadmap: https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/600.
#
# The module repository must contain a .bcr folder containing Publish to BCR templates.
# See https://github.com/bazel-contrib/publish-to-bcr/tree/main/templates.
#
# Repositories containing multiple modules that are versioned together will have all modules included in
# the published entry. This is controlled via the `moduleRoots` property in .bcr/config.yml.

          Whether to open a pull request against the registry after pushing an entry
          to the registry fork. When disabled, a step will run outputting a URL to
          manually create the pull request.

          This should typically be left enabled but can be disabled to support a
          fine-grained access token as the `publish_token` secret. Fine-grained PATs
          do not currently support opening pull requests against public repos.

          If you are not using the reusable release workflow from https://github.com/bazel-contrib/.github/.github/workflows/release_ruleset.yaml

          Whether to open the pull request as a draft.

          This is set to true by default because the Bazel Central Registry has a mechanism to auto-approve a PR
          when marked as ready for review by the author, which is whomever the PAT belongs to. This is a work-around
          for an author not being able to approve their own PR.
          If using a bot account as the author, consider setting draft to false because a human author can approve it.
