# Reusable workflow that can be referenced by repositories in their `.github/workflows/publish.yaml`.
#
# This workflow uses an Action within this repo to generate a BCR entry for
# a tagged release, uploads attestations for the generated source.json and MODULE.bazel files to the release,
# and opens up a pull request against the Bazel Central Registry (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-central-registry).
#
# The workflow requires the following permissions to be set on the invoking job:
#
# permissions:
#   id-token: write        # Needed to attest provenance
#   attestations: write    # Needed to attest provenance
#   contents: write        # Needed to upload release files
#
# The workflow additionally requires a Classic Personal Access Token (PAT) to be supplied in the `publish_token`
# input. The PAT is necessary to push to your BCR fork as well as to open up a pull request against a registry.
# At the moment, fine-grained PATs are not supported because they cannot open pull requests against public 
# repositories, although this is on GitHub's roadmap: https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/600.
#
# The module repository must contain a .bcr folder containing Publish to BCR templates.
# See https://github.com/bazel-contrib/publish-to-bcr/tree/main/templates.
#
# Repositories containing multiple modules that are versioned together will have all modules included in
# the published entry. This is controlled via the `moduleRoots` property in .bcr/config.yml.

        description: The branch of the Bazel registry to open a PR against. Defaults to main.
        default: main
        type: string
      templates_ref:
        description: |
          The git ref to read BCR templates (.bcr folder) rather than reading them from `tag_name`.
          Use this to republish a release whose templates had errors.
        type: string
      attest:
        description: |
          Whether to produce and upload attestations for genrated entry files and create attestations.json.
          Attestations will be uploaded to the release associated with the `tag_name`.

          If you are not using the reusable release workflow from https://github.com/bazel-contrib/.github/.github/workflows/release_ruleset.yaml
          to produce attestations, you may want to skip this.
        default: true
        type: boolean
      draft:
        description: |
          Whether to open the pull request as a draft.
          
          This is set to true by default because the Bazel Central Registry has a mechanism to auto-approve a PR
          when marked as ready for review by the author, which is whomever the PAT belongs to. This is a work-around
          for an author not being able to approve their own PR.
          If using a bot account as the author, consider setting draft to false because a human author can approve it.
          See https://github.com/bazel-contrib/publish-to-bcr/issues/261.
